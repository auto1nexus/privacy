**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025

## 1. Introduction
AUTO1 Nexus respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension. By installing and using the extension, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect
To provide the core functionality of AUTO1 Nexus, we collect and process the following types of data:

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** We collect your name and email address. This information is used strictly to identify your account within our system and manage your user preferences.
- **Authentication Information:** We store OAuth tokens for Google Services and Firebase tokens. These are used solely to securely authenticate your identity and maintain your session state without requiring frequent logins.
- **Personal Communications:** The extension reads Firebase messages to enable the specific feature of generating automated replies. This processing is performed strictly to fulfill the user's request for reply generation.
- **Web History & Website Content:** We access data regarding your browsing activity to generate activity reports. While this data is collected to provide you with insights, any data shared outside the browser environment for reporting purposes is strictly anonymized before export.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information strictly for the following purposes:

- To facilitate secure login and authentication via Google and Firebase.
- To read incoming messages and assist in generating appropriate replies.
- To create anonymized activity reports for operational analysis.

We do not use your data for purposes unrelated to the extension's core functionality, nor do we use it to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.

## 4. Data Disclosure and Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to third parties. We do not share your personal data with external entities, except where necessary to provide the service (e.g., storing data on our secure Firebase infrastructure). As noted above, any web history data included in external reports is anonymized so that it cannot be linked back to a specific individual.

## 5. Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data. All sensitive data transmitted between the extension and our servers (Google Services/Firebase) is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

## 6. Data Retention
We retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. You may request the deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
